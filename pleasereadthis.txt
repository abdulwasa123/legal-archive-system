I’ve implemented the file upload feature on the backend. 
You can now send a request to my API endpoint to upload documents 
with metadata (title, case number, status, etc.) along with the file itself. 
I will give you the API details, expected request format, and the response you’ll get.

API Endpoint URL:

http://localhost:5000/api/documents/upload

Method: POST

Request Type:
multipart/form-data (because it's a file + text fields)

Required Form Data Fields:
Key	         Type	    Description (you are not adding the description its just there for u to understand o)
file	     File	    The document file (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
title	     Text	    Document title
description	 Text	    Short description
caseNumber	 Text	    Case number (e.g., SCM/2024/001)
type	     Text	    Document type (e.g., Judgment)
parties	     Text	    Parties involved
date	     Text	    Date (Format: YYYY-MM-DD)
status	     Text       Active / Closed / Pending
priority	 Text	    High / Medium / Low

These fields must be included in the form.


to Display Uploaded Documents use this endpoint - 

GET http://localhost:5000/api/documents

also to run the backend because the backend has to be running for it to work use npm run devStart
